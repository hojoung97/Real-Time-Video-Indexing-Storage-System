CAM2 Image database team have been working on real time video indexing system. The project is currently work-in-progress with research paper aimed to be completed.

Source code: https://github.com/PurdueCAM2Project/CAM2ImageDatabase

## Overview
The project aims to process incoming video streams from multiple IP cameras around the world, extract features from the frames, store the images as objects along with corresponding features, and make them ready for user query.
